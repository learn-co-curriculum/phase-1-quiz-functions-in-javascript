# Functions: Scope

Which variables does the function `inner2` have access to?

```javascript
const part1 = "hello";

function demoChain(name) {
  let part2 = "hi";
  return function inner1() {
    let part3 = "there";
    return function inner2() {
      // what variables are accessible here?
    };
  };
}

demoChain("Dr. Stephen Strange")()();
```

## Correct

`part1`, `name`, `part2`, `part3`

> Correct! Because of JavaScript's scope rules, the innermost function can access
> variables from outer functions' scope as well.
