# Functions: Scope

Given the following code:

```javascript
function outerFn(outerParam) {
  let outerVar = 0;
  return function innerFn(innerParam) {
    let innerVar = 0;
    // etc
  };
}
```

The `innerFn` function has access to...

## Correct

All of the outer function's parameters as well as variables defined in the outer
function.

## Incorrect

Only the parameters passed into the inner function, and the variables declared
within it.

> Because of JavaScript's scope rules, the inner function has access to the outer
> function's scope from an inner function.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
